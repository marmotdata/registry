The Google Cloud Storage plugin discovers buckets from GCP projects. It captures bucket metadata including location, storage class, encryption settings, and lifecycle rules.

## Required Permissions

The service account needs the following IAM roles:

- **Storage Bucket Viewer** (`roles/storage.bucketViewer`) - For discovering and listing buckets

Or use a custom role with these permissions:
- `storage.buckets.list`
- `storage.buckets.get`
- `storage.objects.list` (if using object count)
